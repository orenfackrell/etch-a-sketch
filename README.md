# etch-a-sketch

The task is to create a grid within which the user's cursor can have two functions either to draw or to erase, these can be selected by the click of a button on the page. The grid within which the user can draw will be a set size but the amount of cells in that grid can be altered by inputs from the user on the page. In the future I would like to add a function when the colour being left as the trail of the user's cursor will cycle through the colours of the rainbow rather than just black.
This project will be utilizing: DOM manipulation from JS; altering css from within my script.js; JS ':hover' affect for the 'drawing'.
